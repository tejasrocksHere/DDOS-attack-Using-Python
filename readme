A Python-based script designed to teach scammers a lesson by flooding their website with concurrent requests. **⚠️ This script is purely educational and intended for testing purposes only.** Use this responsibly and with permission.

# ⚙️ Features
- Sends multiple concurrent HTTP requests to a target website.
- Handles errors like timeouts and invalid responses gracefully.
- Includes safeguards to avoid overwhelming the target server.

## 🛠 How it Works
This script creates multiple threads (by default, 10) to send HTTP GET requests to a specified URL. It can help highlight vulnerabilities in websites that have weak rate-limiting mechanisms or are not optimized to handle concurrent requests.

However, the script should never be used to harm legitimate websites, overwhelm servers without permission, or engage in illegal activity.

## 🚨 **DISCLAIMER** 🚨
**This script should only be used with permission from the website owners.** Overloading or intentionally harming a server is illegal in most jurisdictions and could lead to serious legal consequences, including charges under cybercrime laws. The authors are not responsible for any misuse of this code.

## 🔧 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `concurrent.futures`

You can install the `requests` library via pip:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## 📖 Usage

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anti-scam-web-stress.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd anti-scam-web-stress
    ```

3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python anti_scam.py
    ```

By default, the script sends 10 concurrent requests to the target URL every 5 seconds. You can modify the URL in the script or adjust the number of threads and delay.

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can change the target URL and the number of threads by modifying the following parts in the `anti_scam.py` file:

```python
response = requests.get('https://target-website.com')
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
```

- **`max_workers`**: Number of concurrent threads sending requests.
- **`time.sleep(5)`**: Time delay between request batches.

## 🛡 Responsible Use

This script is **NOT** to be used for malicious purposes. Only use this on websites where you have explicit permission to test for vulnerabilities.
