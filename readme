# Anti-Scam Web Stress Test Script 🚨

A Python-based script designed to teach scammers a lesson by flooding their website with concurrent requests. **⚠️ This script is purely educational and intended for testing purposes only.** Use this responsibly and with permission.

# ⚙️ Features
- Sends multiple concurrent HTTP requests to a target website.
- Handles errors like timeouts and invalid responses gracefully.
- Includes safeguards to avoid overwhelming the target server.

## 🛠 How it Works
This script creates multiple threads (by default, 10) to send HTTP GET requests to a specified URL. It can help highlight vulnerabilities in websites that have weak rate-limiting mechanisms or are not optimized to handle concurrent requests.

However, the script should never be used to harm legitimate websites, overwhelm servers without permission, or engage in illegal activity.

## 🚨 **DISCLAIMER** 🚨
**This script should only be used with permission from the website owners.** Overloading or intentionally harming a server is illegal in most jurisdictions and could lead to serious legal consequences, including charges under cybercrime laws. The authors are not responsible for any misuse of this code.

## 🔧 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `concurrent.futures`

You can install the `requests` library via pip:

```bash
pip install requests
